# circleci.test

A Clojure test-runner compatible with tests written using `clojure.test`

## Usage

Add `[circleci/circleci.test "0.1.37"]` to your dev dependencies.

Run tests with `lein run -m circleci.test my.first.test.ns my.second.test.ns`

### Leiningen plugin
The plugin `circleci/lein-circleci-test` provides a Leiningen task for running
tests. It respects the `:test-selectors` defined in your project.clj

Add `[circleci/lein-circleci-test "0.1.0"]` to your `:plugins`

Run tests with `lein circleci-test`


## Differences from `clojure.test`
* supports more than one test reporter at a time
* includes elapsed time measured with `System/nanoTime` when reporting the end of a `deftest`


## Design goals

#### Compatibility with tests written using `clojure.test`
Don't force people to re-write tests just to use a different test runner.

Maintain compatibility with the `clojure.test` assertion expansions such as [slingshot.test](https://github.com/scgilardi/slingshot/blob/release/src/slingshot/test.clj)

#### Extensible test reporting
Must be possible to use more than one test reporter at a time, for instance it's desirable to produce Junit XML and console output during a test run.
