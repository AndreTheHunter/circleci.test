# circleci.test

A Clojure test-runner compatible with tests written using `clojure.test`.

Keep your existing `deftest`s, but gain flexibility around how you run them.

## Usage

Add `[circleci/circleci.test "0.1.37"]` to your dev dependencies.

Run all tests with `lein run -m circleci.test my.first.test.ns my.second.test.ns`

Run individiual tests from a repl with `(circleci.test/test-var #'my.test.ns/my-test)`

Alternatively you can add an alias:

```clj
:aliases {"test" ["run" "-m" "circleci.test" "my.first.test.ns" "my.second.test.ns"]}
```

This will replace Leiningen's built-in `test` task with this one.

### Selectors

As with Leiningen's built-in `test` task, you can tag tests with metadata
that allows you to run just a selection of your tests.

You can put a keyword argument on the command-line invocation before 
specifying which test namespaces to run, and it will cause all `deftest`
forms which aren't tagged with that metadata to be skipped.

    $ lein run -m circleci.test :integration my.first.test.ns

If you need more flexibility in your test selectors you can define arbitrary
selector functions in `dev-resources/circleci_test/config.clj`:

```clj
{:selectors {:all (constantly true)
             :acceptance (fn [m] (or (:integration m) (:functional m)))
             :default (complement :flaky)}}
```

### Running tests from a repl
Use `circleci.test/test-var` to run a single test fn:
```clojure
(circleci.test/test-var #'my.test.ns/my-test)
```

Use `circleci.test/run-tests` to run all the tests in one or more namespaces:
```clojure
(circleci.test/run-tests 'my.test.ns)
(circleci.test/run-tests 'my.test.ns 'my.other.test.ns)
```

There is also a `circleci.test/run-all-tests` function; however please note that
this only runs tests in namespaces that have already been loaded rather than
running all tests that exist on disk.

### Leiningen plugin
The plugin `circleci/lein-circleci-test` provides a Leiningen task for running
tests. It respects the `:test-selectors` defined in your `project.clj`.

Add `[circleci/lein-circleci-test "0.1.0"]` to your `:plugins`.

Run tests with `lein circleci-test`.

### Test Isolation

Clojure codebases that follow functional programming techniques should follow
the "functional core/imperative shell" model in which most functionality is 
implemented with pure functions, while an outer layer of imperative code ties
things together. Ideally in this case most tests should be unit tests, which
only concern themselves with pure functions and do no I/O. However, it's easy
for impurity to accidentally sneak into a test. In order to prevent this, you
can use the `circleci.test.isolation/enforce` test fixture.

```clj
(use-fixtures :each (isolation/enforce))

(deftest accidentally-uses-io
  (is (re-find #"cx") (get-in (read-parse "sample3") [:body :content 3])))

(def sample3 (read-sample "sample3"))

(deftest actually-pure
  (is (re-find #"cx") (get-in (parse sample3) [:body :content 3])))

(deftest ^:io intentionally-uses-io
  (let [sample3 (read-sample "sample3")
        parsed (parse sample3)]
    (is (re-find #"cx") (get-in parsed [:body :content 3]))))
```

The first test is not a unit test because it calls `read-parse`, a function
that performs I/O. The `isolation/enforce` fixture will cause it to fail, while
the second one will succeed because it only calls `parse`, which is pure. The
third test will also pass because it has explicitly been flagged with `^:io`.

The default isolation blocks use of network and file access and whitelists
`deftest`s which are tagged with `^:io` and `^:integration`. You can pass
arguments to `isolation/enforce` which will provide a fixture that looks for
different set of selector tags or uses a different predicate to determine
which things to block:

```clj
(defn deny? [permission]
  (instance? java.net.SocketPermission permission))

(use-fixtures :each (isolation/enforce [:io :network] deny?))
```

In this example we only block tests which use `SocketPermission`. The `deny?`
predicate will be passed an instance of [java.security.Permission](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/Permission.html)
and must return a boolean indicating whether that permission should be denied.
In this case only `deftest` forms with `^:io` or `^:network` selector tags
will not have that restriction applied.

This feature sets the JVM's [SecurityManager](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/SecurityManager.html)
and will not work with code that assumes it has control of that class.

## Differences from `clojure.test`
* supports more than one test reporter at a time
* includes elapsed time measured with `System/nanoTime` when reporting the end
  of a `deftest`
* test fixtures are run when testing a single test, not just a set of tests
* `:once` fixtures are run exactly once per invocation, whether testing an
  entire namespace or a single test
* test selectors are a part of the library, not a monkeypatch
  

## Caveats
* Invoking a test-fn directly will not run any fixtures at all, exactly like
  `clojure.test`. This is due to behaviour from `clojure.test/deftest` and
  can't be worked around without forcing use of a different `deftest`
  implementation.


## Design goals

#### Compatibility with tests written using `clojure.test`
Don't force people to re-write tests just to use a different test runner.

Maintain compatibility with the `clojure.test` assertion expansions such as [slingshot.test](https://github.com/scgilardi/slingshot/blob/release/src/slingshot/test.clj)

#### Extensible test reporting
Must be possible to use more than one test reporter at a time, for instance it's desirable to produce Junit XML and console output during a test run.
