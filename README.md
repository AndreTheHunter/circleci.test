# circleci.test

A Clojure test-runner compatible with tests written using `clojure.test`.

Keep your existing `deftest`s, but gain flexibility around how you run them.

## Usage

Add `[circleci/circleci.test "0.1.37"]` to your dev dependencies.

Run all tests with `lein run -m circleci.test my.first.test.ns my.second.test.ns`

Run individiual tests from a repl with `(circleci.test/test-var #'my.test.ns/my-test)`

Alternatively you can add an alias:

```clj
:aliases {"test" ["run" "-m" "circleci.test" "my.first.test.ns" "my.second.test.ns"]}
```

This will replace Leiningen's built-in `test` task with this one.

### Selectors

As with Leiningen's built-in `test` task, you can tag tests with metadata
that allows you to run just a selection of your tests.

You can put a keyword argument on the command-line invocation before 
specifying which test namespaces to run, and it will cause all `deftest`
forms which aren't tagged with that metadata to be skipped.

    $ lein run -m circleci.test :integration my.first.test.ns

If you need more flexibility in your test selectors you can define arbitrary
selector functions in `dev-resources/circleci_test/config.clj`:

```clj
{:selectors {:all (constantly true)
             :acceptance (fn [m] (or (:integration m) (:functional m)))
             :default (complement :flaky)}}
```

### Leiningen plugin
The plugin `circleci/lein-circleci-test` provides a Leiningen task for running
tests. It respects the `:test-selectors` defined in your `project.clj`.

Add `[circleci/lein-circleci-test "0.1.0"]` to your `:plugins`.

Run tests with `lein circleci-test`.

### Running tests from a repl
Use `circleci.test/test-var` to run a single test fn:
```clojure
(circleci.test/test-var #'my.test.ns/my-test)
```

Use `circleci.test/run-tests` to run all the tests in one or more namespaces:
```clojure
(circleci.test/run-tests 'my.test.ns)
(circleci.test/run-tests 'my.test.ns 'my.other.test.ns)
```


## Differences from `clojure.test`
* supports more than one test reporter at a time
* includes elapsed time measured with `System/nanoTime` when reporting the end
  of a `deftest`
* test fixtures are run when testing a single test, not just a set of tests
* `:once` fixtures are run exactly once per invocation, whether testing an
  entire namespace or a single test
* test selectors are a part of the library, not a monkeypatch
  

## Caveats
* Invoking a test-fn directly will not run any fixtures at all, exactly like
  `clojure.test`. This is due to behaviour from `clojure.test/deftest` and
  can't be worked around without forcing use of a different `deftest`
  implementation.


## Design goals

#### Compatibility with tests written using `clojure.test`
Don't force people to re-write tests just to use a different test runner.

Maintain compatibility with the `clojure.test` assertion expansions such as [slingshot.test](https://github.com/scgilardi/slingshot/blob/release/src/slingshot/test.clj)

#### Extensible test reporting
Must be possible to use more than one test reporter at a time, for instance it's desirable to produce Junit XML and console output during a test run.
